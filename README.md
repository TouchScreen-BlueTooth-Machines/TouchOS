# TouchOS

## About

An operating system kernel designed for even the oldest computers!

# End of support

TBM INC has decided to end support for TouchOS, with version 6.9 being the final version. We aim to axe that by 2030. The extended support and security updates can be found in the Security directory within this repository. Please be sure to read that and report any issues to us if you feel that there is an issue. If you would like an even longer extension, we are willing to extend support even further for the version of TouchOS that you would like. However, this is only for TouchOS 6.71 and over, TouchOS 6.7 and under will recieve no more extensions.
