# TouchOS

## About

An operating system kernel designed for even the oldest computers!

Sadly, TouchOS versions 1.0-6.6 lost support on Jan 1st 2024. Despite this rather sad turn of events, TouchOS 6.7 and TouchOS 6.71 will continue to recieve updates until March 2024. TouchOS CE (Compact Edition) and TouchOS Server will continue to recieve updates. However, TouchOS CE 2.00 will lose support on Jan 1st 2025 and TouchOS Server 21 will lose support on Jan 1st 2026. We will aim to create TouchOS Server 25 before or during the year 2025, but this may not happen.
